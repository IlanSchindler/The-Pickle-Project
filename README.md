# Pickle Project
#pickleProject

This project was from my Senior year of High School for an Independent Study Engineering class and the benefit of the school's marching band, which was an important part of my High School experience.

In addition to playing at home football games, the school's ~120 member marching band traveled to away games and competitions. 

We used a decommissioned school bus we called The Pickle to transport the larger instruments to and from these performances. To load the Pickle, we had many parents volunteer; they had to lift each instrument onto the bus one by one and strap them in using bungee cords. It was a long process that was taxing on the parents and required a lot of manpower to complete. 

To make this process faster and easier I designed carts that could hold multiple instruments, be rolled up a ramp into The Pickle, and locked in securely. 

In addition to designing the actual carts, this project required me to write several proposals including: to the school district for permission to modify The Pickle, to the teacher responsible for my independent study class for approval, and to the band directors.
I also solicited the band parents for funding.
